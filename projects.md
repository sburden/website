## Sensorimotor Games
In tasks involving adaptive algorithms and continuously-learning humans, 
rich dynamic behaviors can prevent the system from reaching consensus. 
We investigate these fundamental phenomena from the framework of
continuous games: players each have their own preferences
that may be misaligned due to through different task definitions 
or limited communication.

## Haptic Mixed-Reality for Legged Robots
Often computationally efficient models for calculating the ground reaction force of a given terrain are not available, which impedes designing legged robots and gaits by optimization of simulations. We propose a mixed-reality design paradigm, wherein physical robot hardware is coupled to a simulation of virtual robot dynamics in real time through a haptic force rendering system. We apply this approach to the task of synthesizing a hopping gait for a real 2-DOF robotic leg while simultaneously designing a passive suspension for a virtual load mass.
