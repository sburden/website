Joey travels to Macau for the 2019 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

I can't be more excited, since this will be my first trip off of the North American continent. In Macau, I will be presenting my work on [Smellicopter](https://depts.washington.edu/airlab/files/anderson_2019.pdf), a bio-hybrid odor localizing drone. This paper was my first submission on a collaborative project with Melanie Anderson, a third year PhD student in [The Daniel Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/danielt/) and [AIR Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/airlab/). Special thanks to the [Airforce Center of Excellence NIFTI](https://isr.umd.edu/research-funding/afosr-air-force-center-excellence-nature-inspired-flight-technologies-and-ideas) for providing funding for this travel opportunity. See you in Macau!
