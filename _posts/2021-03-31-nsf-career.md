My NSF CAREER proposal was funded through the [Mind, Machine, Motor Nexus (M3X) Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505402)!

The project title is "[human/machine collaborative learning and control for contact-rich dynamics](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2045014)".  I am thrilled and honored to have this proposal selected for funding. The award holds special significance for me, as it represents the genuine merger of two previously-separate threads of research I started in my PhD and postdoc:  modeling and control of contact-rich dynamics, and human sensorimotor learning and control.
