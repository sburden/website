Joseph publishes new research article with UW collaborators in Biology and Mechanical Engineering.

Last year posed unprecedented challenges for all of us, so I'm relieved to have ended 2020 with some good news. 

Back in December, my collaborators and I published [our latest research article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/abbd81/meta?casa_token=SdAZ4jH13HUAAAAA:hmkU4O4dIKAlRcGgIWWXCnEBFypjBmLyaYe5RMw-WU6sGY7uVT4PSuc_1A7yPBBKHx1R08t7) on the Smellicopter project, which appears in the journal *Bioinspiration & Biomimetics*. This research is a continuation of work I did during my master's degree program, under Dr. Tom Daniel (UW Biology) and Dr. Sawyer Fuller (UW Mechanical Engineering). If you are interested in learning about this project, I encourage you to read [this interview](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/smellicopter-drone-live-moth-antenna) with my collaborators that was published in *IEEE Spectrum Magazine*.
