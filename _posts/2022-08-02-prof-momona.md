I am over the moon to share the news that [Momona Yamagami](https://momona-yamagami.github.io/), whose PhD was co-advised by myself and [Kat Steele](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/team_member/kat-m-steele/), was [hired as a tenure-track Assistant Professor](https://eceweb.rice.edu/news/four-new-faculty-join-ece-department) in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University in Houston, TX, USA!!

Momona will start as faculty in Fall 2023 -- in the meantime, she is a [CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/) postdoc in UW CSE advised by [Jennifer Mankoff](https://make4all.org/portfolio/jennifer-mankoff/).  This postdoc position is funded in part by a grant from Meta Research's [Responsible Neural Interface Design](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2021/09/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2021-engineering-approaches-to-responsible-neural-interface-design-request-for-proposals/).

As her co-advisor, I can't help but brag that Momona was the only one of [4 junior faculty hired](https://eceweb.rice.edu/news/four-new-faculty-join-ece-department) in her Department this year directly from their PhD program :)

CONGRATULATIONS, Professor Yamagami !!!
