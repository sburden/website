title: Up for Promotion & Tenure 
---

This is my mandatory year for promotion and tenure evaluation.  I am proud of the work I have accomplished with my students and collaborators on the tenure track, and I am excited for what the future holds.

For those who are interested, I am making available my [CV]({{ site.url }}/2021-Burden-CV.pdf) and [Self-Advocacy statement]({{ site.url }}/2021-Burden-Self-Advocacy.pdf).
