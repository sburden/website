My first grant, an [NSF CRII](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15569/nsf15569.htm), was awarded through the Cyber-Physical Systems ([CPS](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503286)) program under PM David Corman!  

See the [NSF page](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1565529&HistoricalAwards=false) for the award abstract.

See my [department's announcement](https://www.ee.washington.edu/news/2016/SamBurdenReceivesNSFCPSResearchInitiationAward.html) for an overview fit for public consumption.
