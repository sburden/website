[Tom Libby](https://tlibby14.github.io) and I have just received a new award from the NSF [National Robotics Initiative (NRI) program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641) for our proposal on [design of dynamic multibehavioral robots](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1924303).

This is a [collaborative project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1924723) with [Aaron Johnson](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/amj1/) from CMU ME / RI.
