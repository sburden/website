My second grant, an [ARO YIP](http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=8), was awarded through the [Mechanical Sciences Division](http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=206) under PM Samuel Stanton's Complex Dynamics and Systems program!  

See my [department's announcement](https://www.ee.washington.edu/news/2016/SamBurdenAROYIPAward.html) for an overview fit for public consumption.
