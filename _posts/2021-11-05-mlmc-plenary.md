I gave a plenary talk at MLMC 2021 -- the [Conference on Motor Learning and Motor Control](http://motor-conference.org/).

This year's meeting is organized by [Maurice Smith](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/person/maurice-smith), [Alaa Ahmed](https://www.colorado.edu/mechanical/alaa-ahmed), and [Adrian Haith](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/adrian-haith).
I am thrilled and honored to give this presentation!

I talked about [sensorimotor games]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20211104-mlmc.pptx) -- video will be posted soon.
