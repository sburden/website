I'm excited to participate in an [NSF workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/formalization-of-human-factors/home) focused on envisioning the future of the [M3X](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/m3x-mind-machine-motor-nexus) program that funded [my CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2045014). This workshop was organized by Meeko Oishi, Wendy Ju, Ufuk Topcu, and Brian Scasaletti.
