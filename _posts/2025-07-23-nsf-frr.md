I'm co-PI on a new NSF [Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/frr-foundational-research-robotics) grant with [Kim Ingraham](https://kim-ingraham.com/) combining exoskeletons and game theory!

The project title is "[Adapting Exoskeleton Assistance Using Game Theory Algorithms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2447698)". The idea for this project initially came together after [my talk at the 2022 Dynamic Walking Meeting](https://faculty.washington.edu/sburden/_talks/20220615-dw.pdf) in Madison, WI -- [watch the video here](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/DW22_Burden,+Sam+-+June+15th+2022,+10A52A00+am/1_b22fx5a7). I'm really excited to see how it shakes out!
