I am thrilled to announce that we've officially launched our new [Center for Amplifying Movement and Performance](http://depts.washington.edu/amplify)!

Based in our [new shared facility](http://depts.washington.edu/amplify/lab) and [generously funded](https://www.engr.washington.edu/mycoe/research/sri) by the College of Engineering, together with [Kat Steele](http://depts.washington.edu/uwsteele/), [Eric Rombokas](http://www.rombokas.com/eric/), [Chet Moritz](http://depts.washington.edu/moritlab/), and [Val Kelly](http://faculty.washington.edu/vekelly/) we'll be meeting regularly to establish interdisciplinary working groups and lead training and teambuilding workshops.

**If you're interested in working on a project in the space, consider joining our inaugural class of [AMP Fellows](http://depts.washington.edu/amplify/fellows).**
