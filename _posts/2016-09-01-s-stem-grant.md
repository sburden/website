I am thrilled to join the team, led by UW CoE Assoc Dean / EE Prof [Eve Riskin](http://www.ee.washington.edu/faculty/riskin/), that just received an [NSF S-STEM](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5257) [grant to expand innovative "academic redshirts" programs](http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1564656&HistoricalAwards=false)!

Borrowing a metaphor from [sportsball](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sportsball), the aim of "academic redshirts" programs is to provide focused mentoring and tailored curriculum that supports talented students from underrepresented populations to succeed in STEM fields; see [this Seattle Times article](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/uws-stars-helps-low-income-students-shine/) or [this CBS video](https://iqmediacorp.com/ClipPlayer/?ClipID=4037f579-efc0-4955-b564-445e2310ceeb) for more details.  This S-STEM grant will enable existing programs at [UW](https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/stars), [WSU](https://vcea.wsu.edu/stars/), and [CU](http://www.colorado.edu/bold/goldshirt) to expand, and new programs at UCSD, UIUC, and BSU to launch.  As a first-generation college graduate, I am particularly enthusiastic about the mission of this program!
