I received notice from [my University's Academic HR](https://ap.washington.edu/ahr/) that my promotion to Associate Professor with Tenure has been approved, effective September 16 2022.

I also received notice from [my College's HR](https://www.engr.washington.edu/mycoe/hr) that my request for sabbatical leave for the 9 months of the 2022-2023 academic year was approved.

For those who are interested, I am making the following materials available:
* the [faculty application]({{ site.url }}/2013-Burden-UW-EE-Faculty-Application.pdf) I submitted to UW EE (now ECE);
* the [CV]({{ site.url }}/2021-Burden-CV.pdf) and [Self-Advocacy statement]({{ site.url }}/2021-Burden-Self-Advocacy.pdf) I submitted with my application for tenure;
* my [sabbatical plan]({{ site.url }}/2022-2023-Burden-Sabbatical-Plan.pdf)  for the 2022--2023 academic year.
