I've been thinking about writing this post for a very long time.  I want to share my experience with illness.  There are many reasons motivating this disclosure.  I want to share my lived experiences with my colleagues so I can offer some explanation (but not excuse) for various ways I (perceive to) have "dropped the ball" over the years -- on papers, proposals, projects, and other plans.  I want to use my privilege as a tenured white cishet male professor to, hopefully, help de-stigmatize illness in academia (hence) encourage more open dialogue and broader participation in this profession.  And I want to connect with others to build community; the handful of interactions I've had with folks that share some of my experiences have affected me profoundly and benefitted me tremendously as I navigate my own circumstances.

My illness has caused me to feel a lot of things over the years.  Frustration at how much labor it takes to manage.  Resentment toward people who don't have similar struggles (of course I don't actually know what's happening in others' lives).  Despair that I'll never get "better".  Shame about how much it interferes with my productivity (I am in a publicly-funded position, after all -- perhaps someone less-afflicted would make more efficient use of the public's support).  

Those are the negative emotions -- there's also a positive side to my emotional landscape.  Gratitude that my illness is manageable at all (I'm still here!), because I'm well aware that I occupy a comfortable seat on the struggle bus -- easily business class or better.  Joy in the work and accomplishments I have taken part in, despite the obstacles.  [Equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Yoga_(book)).  Purpose.  And, increasingly, community: having my own struggles puts me in a better position to help others identify and navigate their own -- people who haven't (yet) had major illness [just can't even](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/i-can-t-even).

## thanks

Before going any further, I want to express my deepest gratitude to colleagues who have disclosed their own struggles with illness, whether privately to me or publicly to our community.  Both actions are incredibly courageous (one cannot know with certainty that private disclosures won't ever be made public).  

Of course I cannot publicly call out individuals in the former group, but they know who they are, so I can speak directly to them:  I am so happy to have you in my life as a colleague and friend; you have given me a precious gift I will always cherish; I celebrate every day that we persist -- we are still here!

The folks in the latter group are few and far between -- I have been particularly inspired by the trailblazing advocacy and scholarship of [Kay Jamison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Unquiet_Mind), [Susan Wendell](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3810781), and [Jen Mankoff](https://make4all.org/). 

## symptoms

I first started experiencing [intermittently-disabling](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html) illness early in grad school (though only recently have I begun to view my experiences through the lens of [disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_studies)).  By my second year as a PhD student, I found myself with debilitating pain in my arms, neck, and shoulders.  I was able to use a computer for 30 minutes a day, maximum, for months.  Each day would end with painful muscle spasms.  The effect on my personal and professional life was profound.

In my attempt to manage this illness on my own, I tried improving my [computer ergonomics](https://uhs.umich.edu/computerergonomics) (changing [keyboard](https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/goldtouch-go2-wired-mobile-keyboard-pc-mac) and [mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html) helped the most), taking over-the-counter painkillers daily ([not a great idea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158445/), as it turns out), mineral baths, taking breaks, etc.  Each intervention generally offered some limited relief, but nothing came remotely close to a "cure".

To accomodate my impairments, I adapt to my new circumstances.
