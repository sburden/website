[Lillian Ratliff](http://faculty.uw.edu/ratliffl) and I have just received a new award from the NSF [Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503286) for our proposal on [certifiable reinforcement learning for CPS](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1836819).

This is a [collaborative project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1836932) with [Sam Coogan](http://coogan.ece.gatech.edu/) from GATech ECE / CEE, and involves interdisciplinary training activities with [Ryan Calo](https://www.law.uw.edu/directory/calo-ryan) and the [Tech Policy Lab](http://techpolicylab.org/).
