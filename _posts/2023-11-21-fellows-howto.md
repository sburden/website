[Momona Yamagami](https://momona-yamagami.github.io/) and I added a *Fellows* program to the 2022 IFAC Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS). In addition to [raising funds from NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2216526), we invested substantial effort in thinking through each element of a Fellows program. Looking back, we are proud of the work we did and the impact it had on the 13 early-career researchers we supported, so we want to share materials that may be useful to others seeking to do similar work.

You can access the content here:

* [accessible pdf version]({{ site.url }}/fellows/fellows-howto.pdf).

As a final note, we want to acknowledge that we built on past successes of the *Inclusion@RSS* and *NeuroMatch* programs that provided scaffolding to broaden participation in the Robotics and Neuroscience communities. We hope you are able to build on our work as well.
