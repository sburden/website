As the absent co-organizer of last year's meeting, 
it was a pleasure to attend [Dynamic Walking](http://dynamicwalking.org/) (DW) this year -- doubly so since it was at such an outrageously beautiful location! 

I presented recent work on the question "why (or, more specifically, when) do feedforward inputs yield stable behaviors?" via a combination [slideshow]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw.pptx) / "[chalk talk]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw-chalk-talk.pdf)" on [our recent contraction theory results for hybrid systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04122), while my PhD student Bora Banjanin presented on our results about [nonsmooth optimal value and policy functions in contact-rich dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06745).
