January was **the** month for workshops.

First, I attended the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology ([SICB](www.sicb.org/)) in Portland, OR, USA with my first student, Bora Banjanin, who presented a new technique for [estimating predictive models of legged locomotion from data]({{ site.url }}/papers/conferences_bib.html#BanjaninBurden2016sicb) to a standing-room-only audience!

Second, I presented on [predictive dynamical models for legged locomotion]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20160122-neuromech.pptx) at the 5th and final NSF RCN winter workshop on neuromechanics and dynamics of locomotion in New Orleans, LA, USA.  Bora presented a poster on his SICB results:

Third, I presented on [predictive dynamical models for sensorimotor control]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20160129-uwin-ncec.pptx) at the [UWIN Neural Computation and Engineering Connection](http://uwin.washington.edu/ncec/) in Seattle, WA, USA.
