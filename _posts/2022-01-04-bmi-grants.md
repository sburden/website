[Amy Orsborn](http://faculty.washington.edu/aorsborn/) and I received two grants to study sensorimotor control in Brain/Machine Interfaces (BMI)!

The first is an [Ignition Award](https://wanprc.uw.edu/2021-ignition-awards-recipients-named/) from the [Washington State National Primate Research Center](https://wanprc.uw.edu/) (WANPRC) to study feedforward and feedback control.

The second is an [EAGER](https://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/submit.jsp) from the NSF [Mind, Machine, Motor Nexus (M3X) program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mind-machine-and-motor-nexus-m3x) for our proposal on [bidirectional body-brain-machine interfaces](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2124608).
