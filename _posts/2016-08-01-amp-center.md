The UW CoE [Strategic Research Initiative](https://www.engr.washington.edu/mycoe/research/sri) (SRI) proposal I wrote in collaboration with [Kat Steele](http://depts.washington.edu/uwsteele/), [Eric Rombokas](http://www.rombokas.com/eric/), [Chet Moritz](http://depts.washington.edu/moritlab/), and [Val Kelly](http://faculty.washington.edu/vekelly/) was funded!  This award will enable us to launch an interdisciplinary **Center for Analysis of Motion and Performance in Humans and Machines** (AMP Center) based out of our new motion analysis facility in [Wallace Hall](http://www.washington.edu/maps/2011/04/28/acc/) (photo above shows renovation progress as of July 26 2016).

Motivation for the Center (from the proposal):

> Human interaction with the physical world is increasingly mediated by machines that monitor, learn from, adapt to, and enhance the ability of their human partners.  This technological trend will undoubtedly influence a variety of engineering disciplines (e.g. transportation, communication, energy), but we foresee outsized impact in engineering health.  We envision a future where: neurophysiological trauma and disease are diagnosed automatically (and, when possible, preemptively); monitoring and intervention are conducted continuously within and outside the clinic; and personalized assistive devices ranging from exoskeletons to co-robots mitigate disability and enhance ability of all individuals, as needed.
