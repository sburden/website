It's no secret that [Dynamic Walking](http://dynamicwalking.org/) (DW) is my **favorite** academic meeting.  It's everything that the massive, 20+ parallel-track conferences I frequent (which I won't name, [but](http://www.icra2015.com/) [will](http://www.ieeecss.org/CAB/conferences/cdcecc2011/) [link](http://www.iros2016.org/) [to](http://acc2016.a2c2.org/)) aren't.  Faculty mix with students, everyone attends the talks, there are lively group discussions, and, amazingly, tons of time for socializing and recreating.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the meeting's (semi-)formal existence, so they organized it at a very special location &mdash; a YMCA summer camp in rural Michigan!
