I've been thinking about writing this post for a very long time.  I want to share my experience with illness.  

There are many reasons motivating this disclosure.  

I want to share my lived experiences with my colleagues so I can offer some explanation (but not excuse) for various ways I (perceive to) have "dropped the ball" over the years -- on papers, proposals, projects, and other plans.  I want to use my privilege as a white cishet male tenured professor to, hopefully, help de-stigmatize illness in academia and (hence) encourage more open dialogue about and broader participation in this profession.  And I want to connect with others to build community; the handful of interactions I've had with folks that share some of my experiences have affected me profoundly and benefitted me tremendously as I navigate my own circumstances.

My illness has caused me to feel a lot of things over the years.  Frustration at how much labor it takes to manage.  Resentment toward people who don't have similar struggles (of course I don't actually know what's happening in others' lives).  Despair that I'll never get "better".  Shame about how much it interferes with my productivity (I am in a publicly-funded position, after all -- perhaps someone less-afflicted would make more efficient use of the public's support).  

Those are the negative emotions -- there's also a positive side to my emotional landscape.  Gratitude that my illness is manageable at all (I'm still here!), because I'm well aware that I occupy a comfortable seat on the struggle bus -- easily business class or better.  Joy in the work and accomplishments I have taken part in, despite the obstacles.  [Equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Yoga_(book)).  Purpose.  And, increasingly, service: having my own struggles puts me in a better position to help others identify and navigate their own -- people who haven't (yet) had major illness [just can't even](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/i-can-t-even).

## thanks

Before going any further, I want to express my deepest gratitude to colleagues who have disclosed their own struggles with illness, whether privately to me or publicly to our community.  Both actions are incredibly courageous (as I discuss in more detail below, one cannot know with certainty that private disclosures won't ever be made public).  

Of course I cannot publicly call out individuals in the former group, but they know who they are, so I can speak directly to them:  I am so happy to have you in my life as a colleague and friend; you have given me a precious gift I will always cherish; I celebrate every day that we persist -- *we are still here!*

The folks in the latter group are few and far between -- I have been particularly inspired by the trailblazing advocacy and scholarship of [Kay Jamison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Unquiet_Mind), [Susan Wendell](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3810781), and [Jen Mankoff](https://make4all.org/). 

## symptoms, pt. 1 -- "physical" health

I first started experiencing (what I now recognize as) [intermittently-disabling](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html) illness early in grad school (only recently have I begun to view my experiences through the lens of [Disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_studies)).  By my second year as a PhD student, I found myself with debilitating pain in my arms, neck, and shoulders.  I was able to use a computer for 30 minutes a day, maximum, for months.  Each day would end with painful muscle spasms.  The consequences for my personal and professional life were profound.

It's worth dwelling on the consequences for a [sec](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hot_second).

Computer use is central to academic work.  In particular, I use computers to collect and analyze data, write code, write papers, report to sponsors, present to colleagues, and communicate with you, dear reader.  So I seriously considered the prospect of dropping out of grad school -- whether by choice or due to lack of progress through the program.

Beyond computer use, there was a constellation of other activities that "aggravated my symptoms" (by which I mean "caused me debilitating pain") running the gamut from exercise (I had to give up yoga and rock climbing) to travel (not being able to move or stretch for long periods, lifting / carrying bags) and countless mundane, routing, everyday things I took for granted before this illness (literally sitting!  it was excrutiating to attend classes, seminars, conferences, meetings, etc).

Sometime in the middle of this, [I herniated my L2 disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_disc_herniation) (pro tip:  if you're trying to pull a rug out from under a piece of furniture, get someone to lift the furniture).  In addition to introducing a new source of chronic and intermittently-disabling pain, the injury partially de-enervated my right leg, causing intermittent numbness in my gastroc and significant loss of muscle mass in my quad.  I remained ambulatory, but with even more limitations on my movement.

## an aside

At this point in my narrative, I'm imagining some readers thinking I'm exaggerating symptoms or seeking attention or rationalizing laziness or making a bigger deal out of all of this than my circumstances justified.  After all, everyone has obstacles to overcome -- many much more significant than mine.  I'm not special, other than the obvious privilege {% cite McIntosh2007-hu --file illness %} and narcissism that motivates me to blast this story on the interwebs.  This is probably, mostly, just me [projecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) my own insecurities.  But if you happen to find yourself thinking any of these things (even dimly), you are in good company:  I think them all day, every day.  

## diagnosis & treatment

Initially, I thought I was experiencing temporary impairments due to chronic overuse, so I tried improving my [computer ergonomics](https://uhs.umich.edu/computerergonomics) (I still use the [keyboard](https://shop.goldtouch.com/products/goldtouch-go2-wired-mobile-keyboard-pc-mac) and [mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html)), taking over-the-counter painkillers daily ([not a great idea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3158445/), as it turns out), mineral baths, regular breaks, stretches, low-impact exercise, etc.  Each self-prescribed intervention offered some limited relief, but nothing came remotely close to a "cure".  

Eventually I worked up the courage to seek professional care, so I marched down to the [Tang Center](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/).  A doctor referred me to physical therapy, where I had the pleasure of working with a wonderful PT -- one of two medical providers whose contributions to my graduate school experience warranted an acknowledgement in [my thesis](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-167.html).

Physical therapy helped but did not "cure" my symptoms, so after exhausting my insurance's generous (lol) allotment of sessions, I took my PT's advice and tried acupuncture (turns out there's [reasonably good evidence](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2013.285478) supporting efficacy of acupuncture for chronic pain).  This also helped, for reasons that remain mysterious ([not only to me](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-6-25)), earning the second acknowledgement in [my thesis](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2014/EECS-2014-167.html) to a medical provider.

## prognosis

After years of PT & acupuncture I saw a neurologist and got a second opinion from another GP outside the University Health System, both of whom offered the very helpful observation that I will generously paraphrase as "you are too young to be having these problems".

So I resigned myself to living with these impairments.  I accepted that I had to respect a laundry list of hard constraints:  limit computer use; don't sit too long; don't stand too long; do daily PT exercises; but don't exercise too much; ...  Not ideal, but life could certainly be worse.

## symptoms, pt. 2 -- "mental" health

I first realized there was a problem when I started getting panic attacks.  If you've never had the experience of losing control of your body, feeling like your insides are bursting out while your outsides are crushing in, wanting / needing / begging for any way to *make it stop*:  [bless your heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bless_your_heart).  

The panic set in at the end of my first summer as an Asst Prof, a few weeks before the Fall quarter began.  I was familiar with anxiety -- I've had a potpourri of [textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder) [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder) tracing all the way back to some of my earliest childhood memories.

## on disclosure

There's an interesting "game" that the chronically ill and/or disabled play with disclosure in their professional spheres.  

On the one hand, choosing not to disclose limits our access to accommodations that could level the playing field as we work with and perhaps compete against our healthy non-disabled colleagues.  Of course this effectively puts the burden of access entirely on us, even though we believe that [disability resides without, not within](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability).

On the other hand, disclosing and requesting accommodations from one's employer and colleagues can have enormous costs -- both internal and external.  

For instance, someone (like me) may feel intense shame about their circumstances.  Of course this is something the individual can (and I do) work to free themselves from (e.g. through group and individual therapy).  But it can nevertheless be extremely taxing and, therefore, make avoiding disclosure altogether an extremely appealing option.  

Externally, there are no shortage of stigmas and irrational beliefs programmed into each of us since birth about illness and disability.  Who among us (other than perhaps those who have had extensive experience with disability) does not reflexively associate disability with deficiency -- moral, physical, and/or cognitive?  Who doesn't pity the ill and feel gratitude for one's health?  Exposing oneself to the constant judgement, othering, pity masquerading as sympathy, and awkwardness is a *major* disincentive to disclosure.

But that's all "just" subjective -- the opinions of self and other.  What about economic consequences and opportunity costs?

Speaking specifically to the academic sphere:  will disclosure affect evaluations for promotion and/or tenure?  Will it make program managers less likely to fund me?  Will I get invited to give talks or collaborate on projects less often?  Will prospective students and postdocs choose other advisors?  Will I be sidled with extra (often hidden and unrecognized) service in my Department / College / University / professional society / academic community?  Will colleagues question my fitness to do this job?  Will they regret hiring me in the first place?  I'm a worrier -- I could go on.

It's also important to recognize that, to whatever extent the stigmas and concerns described above are real, selective disclosure gives others power over you.  Let me explain.  Suppose I disclose to my HR department and request a corresponding accommodation.  In the implementation of the accommodation, at least one of my colleagues will be made aware of the fact that an accommodation is needed.  Although [it is illegal in the US](https://www.ada.gov/) for that person to disclose to anyone else (other than those strictly necessary to implement the accommodation), and *even more illegal* (is that a thing? [IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL)) to discriminate against me because of my request for accommodations, it is entirely within that person's power to do either.  And if they're careful, they will be practically immune to consequences:  all it takes to spread information is a few words spoken in private; and discrimination can manifest in myriad subtle ways.

So the fourth reason I am choosing to disclose now in this very public way is that I do not want to grant others power over me.  This is my body, these are my circumstances, and I choose to live with them.

Also putting all my cards on the table in this way means ([the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology)) "they" *really* can't fire me for my illness :)
