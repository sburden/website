# Fellows
Thanks to [an award from NSF's CNS Division](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2216526), we have funding to sponsor travel and registration costs for 10 students and early-career researchers from historically underrepresented groups affiliated with US institutions to participate in CPHS 2022!  Beyond providing financial support to cover (or largely offset) meeting participation costs, we seek to create a sense of community among CPHS Fellows by establishing formal *Mentorship* and *Orientation* structures (details to come -- if you are interested in serving as a Mentor, please sign up here:  [https://forms.gle/MACkApSgMkoRw6n18](https://forms.gle/MACkApSgMkoRw6n18)).  

You are in the best position to determine whether you identify as a student / early-career researcher and member of a historically-underrepresented group in your research community, the latter of which includes but is not limited to women, underrepresented minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA+, and people with disabilities.  You will not be expected or required to declare the group(s) you identify with to participate in the Fellows program.

We encourage folks to apply regardless of whether they are co-author on a paper accepted for publication at the meeting -- our intention is to help broaden participation in the community in this and future years.

# Application and selection
Use the following form to apply to the Fellows program:
[https://forms.gle/hgopmnMn3bySjYWv9](https://forms.gle/hgopmnMn3bySjYWv9)

**The priority deadline for applications is Fri Oct 21 2022** ([anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)), but we will continue to evaluate applications on a rolling basis until all of our funds have been committed.

We aim to make initial selections by Mon Oct 31 2022 for prospective Fellows that apply by the priority deadline, and will endeavor to respond to applications received after the priority deadline within one week.

# Eligibility and selection criteria

The eligibility requirements to receive travel funds are that you:
* self-identify as a member of a historically-underrepresented group in your research community;
* are currently affiliated with a US institution.

There are no eligibility requirements related to your stage of career, prior participation in CPHS or similar conferences, authorship of papers published in this or prior CPHS conferences.  

The selection criteria we will use are:  
* financial need; 
* institutional affiliation; 
* potential benefit to applicant; 
* potential benefit to CPHS community. 

Our primary goal is to incorporate people who do not currently identify as being a part of the CPHS community but are in adjacent areas of research (e.g., neuroscience, neuroengineering, health, human-computer interaction, accessibility, etc.) who may be interested in participating.


# Reimbursement for travel expenses
We are still determining the exact processes for how travel expenses will be reimbursed -- we will update this page and notify Fellows as soon as we are able.

However, all travel will need to conform to the [University of Washington travel policies](https://finance.uw.edu/travel/airfare), including the [Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act).

# Professional resume, CV, website
A central part of the [hidden curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum) in academic research is how you as a researcher present yourself to the community -- there are specific types of information and styles of presentation that people expect to see, but this "folk knowledge" is often not explicitly discussed or taught.  To help break down this barrier to participation, we are providing some examples and guidance for creating a professional resume, [curriculum vitae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae) ("CV"), and/or website.

[This Cornell University's Graduate School page](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/career-and-professional-development/pathways-to-success/prepare-for-your-career/take-action/resumes-and-cvs/) provides an excellent overview of the structure and purpose for creating an academic resume or CV.  

We have provided an [academic CV template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9vUb5_2DdnV-hSF_iClYhsJgE-cMFDW6WoFZvi-zzc/edit#) that is representative of a (highly-accomplished) early-career graduate student -- you are welcome to copy and edit this document to draft your own CV.

If you have not previously created one of these documents, it is important to know that there are no expectations or requirements regarding the number of pages or exact formatting.  Although fancy fonts and stylish layouts are commonly seen in resumes prepared for positions in private industry, on the academic side things are usually more plain and conventional.  (You are welcome to express your individuality and creativity if you'd like! But it is not expected or required.)

Similar guidelines apply to professional websites:  although some people's sites are fancier than others, the most common approach is to find and edit a simple template to include essential information (e.g. your current position and institutional affiliation, any publications or presentations, and contact information).  Some common tools with excellent templates to create an academic website are [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Jemdoc](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyll-themes.com/academic/).

As a final note:  although having both a professional resume / CV *and* website would be ideal by the time you apply for jobs or internships, only one of these is required for the Fellows application (resume / CV *or* website).
