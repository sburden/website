# celebrating 500 years of innovation

![celebrating 500 years of innovation]({{ site.url }}/leo/leo.jpg)

> On the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci's death, the UW welcomed historian Domenico Laurenza, renowned for his research on Leonardo's Codex Leicester and studies on flight. Laurenza presented a public lecture, followed by a panel of UW faculty in fields including biology, art history, and aeronautical engineering discussing Leonardo's impact on their own disciplines. Prior to the lecture, a public exhibition with demonstrations illustrated the interface of science, art, and technology, and connected Leonardo's worldview with that of contemporary Seattle.

# humans in-the-loop with machines

Planes assist pilots, cars assist drivers and robots assist surgeons. Human interaction with the physical world is increasingly mediated by intelligent machines that learn from and adapt to their human partners and environments. Our research focuses on the dynamics of human/machine interaction, with an emphasis on human-in-the-loop control of robots and assistive devices. In this exhibit, games allow participants to pilot a vehicle through an obstacle course, synchronize with a digital choreographer or help a robot take its first steps.
