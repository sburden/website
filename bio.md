I am an Associate Professor with tenure (effective September 16, 2022) in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UW Seattle,
and I served as my Department's (first) Associate Chair for DEI (DEI = Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) in the 2021--2022 academic year.  I was also a founding co-director of the [AMP Center](http://depts.washington.edu/amplify). 

I am broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control; I focus on applications in robotics, neuroengineering, and human-cyber-physical systems.

I've taught the following courses:
* [EE 201](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1695989) (Computer Hardware Skills) in Winter 2024
* [EE 397](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1747015) (Sex & Gender in Engineering) in Fall 2024
* [EE 406](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1718608) (Teaching Engineering) in Spring 2024
* [EE 447](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1663480) (Control Systems Analysis) in Fall 2019, Fall 2020, Fall 2021, Fall 2023

## brief bio

Sam Burden earned his BS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2008.  He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California in Berkeley in 2014, where he subsequently spent one year as a Postdoctoral Scholar.  In 2015, he returned to UW EE (now ECE) as an Assistant Professor, where he received awards for research (Young Investigator Program, Army Research Office, 2016; CAREER, National Science Foundation, M3X program, 2021) and service (Junior Faculty Award, UW College of Engineering, 2021). Sam served as his Department's (first) Associate Chair for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in 2021--2022 and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2022.  He is broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control.  Specifically, he focuses on applications in robotics, neuroengineering, and (human-)cyber-physical systems.  Sam lives with chronic illness, and is happy to meet with anyone who identifies as disabled or chronically ill.

## research program

I am always eager to recruit motivated and independent folks.  If you're interested in joining my group, I encourage you to get in contact with me.  Ideally we'll meet in person, e.g. at a conference, but we can also connect over email.  

Before reaching out, look at my recent [papers]({{ site.url }}/papers), [talks]({{ site.url }}/talks), and/or videos below, and let me know (a) what ideas or problems you find particularly interesting and (b) how you would want to contribute.

### Why (or, more specifically, when) do feedforward inputs yield stable behaviors? ([slides]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw.pptx)) ([chalk talk]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw-chalk-talk.pdf)) 

At the 2018 Dynamic Walking meeting in Pensacola, FL, I gave a hybrid slideshow / "chalk talk" on our contraction theory results, which generated a lot of interesting discussions.
