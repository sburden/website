# Control theory with humans "in the loop"

Planes assist pilots, cars assist drivers and robots assist surgeons. Human interaction with the physical world is increasingly mediated by intelligent machines that learn from and adapt to their human partners and environments. Our research focuses on the dynamics of human/machine interaction, with an emphasis on human-in-the-loop control of robots and assistive devices.

**Prof Sam Burden**
earned his BS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2008.  He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California in Berkeley in 2014, where he subsequently spent one year as a Postdoctoral Scholar.  In 2015, he returned to UW EE (now ECE) as an Assistant Professor.  Sam is broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control.
