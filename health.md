My health issues have caused me a lot of [feels](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/all-the-feels-meme-word-meaning) over the years.  Frustration at how much work it takes to manage them.  Resentment toward people who don't have similar struggles (*though of course I don't actually know what's happening in others' lives*).  Despair that I'll never get "better" (*[what's recovery mean, anyway?](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/742/the-thing-im-getting-over)*).  Worry about the impact on my friends (*no one wants to be a **[Burden]({{ site.url }}/bio)***) and family (*some of my struggles have [genetic factors](https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/carers-hub/does-mental-illness-run-in-families/)*).  Shame about how much it interferes with my productivity (*after all, I am a [civil servant](https://ofm.wa.gov/state-human-resources/civil-service-rules/civil-service-rules-wac-357) -- perhaps someone less-afflicted would make more efficient use of the public's resources?*).  

Those are the negative emotions; there's also a positive side to my emotional landscape.  Gratitude that my issues have been manageable at all, because I've opened my eyes and ears enough to become aware that I'm in a comfortable seat on the struggle bus -- easily business class.  Joy in the [work and accomplishments]({{ site.url }}/2021-Burden-Self-Advocacy.pdf) I have taken part in, despite the obstacles.  [Equanimity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Yoga_(book)).  Purpose.  The fact is, having my struggles puts me in a better position to help others identify and navigate their own -- people who haven't (yet) had to face a health crisis [just can't even]({{ site.url }}/images/even.jpg).

I have several goals for this article.  

Selfishly, I want to chronicle my experiences and consolidate the rationales I have developed as a guide for myself while I continue to muddle through.  When I'm doing well, I can see ways that experience with illness can benefits both self and others.  But when I'm ill, it is hard to see past my "failings".  Perhaps if I write a guidebook I can better navigate these treacherous waters.

More altruistically, I want to provide fair warning to my colleagues and potential collaborators / mentees:  my ambition frequently exceeds my capacity, and I can become very ill very quickly with little advance notice.  Although I endeavor to minimize the impact of my limitations and compensate for the costs incurred, I want to provide information I view as important for others to decide whether and how to interact with me.

But most importantly, I regard it as critical that we do any and all work we can to de-stigmatize health struggles -- particularly mental illness, since many/most of us have internalized biases against its legitimacy.  Beyond discussing and validating the (very real, very heavy) suffering that's entailed, I want to call attention to the fact that ***[this shit can kill you](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/suicide/symptoms-causes/syc-20378048)***.  As foreshadowed by the profanity and link in the previous sentence, this article is going to be quite "raw".  I'm going to get into the deep dark places most of us try not to think about or discuss.  **Consider this a trigger warning for self-harm & suicidal ideation *et al*.**

## childhood

I have [Adverse Childhood Experience](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/index.html)s and [genetic factors](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-use-disorder/genetics-alcohol-use-disorder) that pre-dispose me to a constellation of [debilitating](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html) [illnesses](https://stopabusecampaign.org/take-your-ace-test/what-does-your-ace-score-mean/ace-score-of-7/) and [disorders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0634-7).  To put it succinctly:  I was [emotionally abused](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/what-is-child-abuse/types-of-abuse/emotional-abuse/) by one of my parents (diligent readers of [my blog]({{ site.url }}/blog) can infer their gender identity), and most people in my family (immediate and extended) have or had untreated [substance use disorders](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health).

The trauma I endured as a child instilled in me a deep and abiding self-hatred.  I thought I deserved the mistreatment I experienced.  We're told that parents love unconditionally -- how much of a monster must I be to have that supposedly universal privilege denied me?   I concluded that there must be something deeply flawed and unwanted inside me.

I've experienced intense [suicidal ideation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation) as long as I can remember.  When extremely upset, I ruminate on being [unalive](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/unalive/), on want to stop existing.  I grew up thinking this was "normal" -- that everyone retreats to this deep dark place from time to time.  As an adult, I now recognize these thoughts as alarming symptoms of underlying illness (and, in such a young child, suggestive of abuse or trauma).

There were also telltale signs of anxiety:  bedwetting; physical tics that others notice (*and mock*); extreme distress at perceived failures or mistakes; aversion to social or group activities; head- and stomach-aches.

To confirm / clarify, I'm not sharing all this crap to elicit pity or darken your day.  My negative experiences were more than compensated by other people in my life who did (and do) love me unconditionally.
